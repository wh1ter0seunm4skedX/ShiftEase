## Project Overview

This upcoming web application is designed to serve as a comprehensive management tool for event managers and employees. 🎉 The primary goal of this project is to streamline the scheduling and tracking of shifts, enhancing communication and efficiency during events. 📅✨

### Current Status 🚧

This project is currently in the **design phase**. While development has not yet commenced, the foundational structure is outlined to ensure a robust and user-friendly application. 🛠️

## Project Components

### Frontend 🎨

The frontend will be developed using probably **React.js**. The design will focus on creating an intuitive and responsive layout catering to managers and employees. Key features will include:

- **User Authentication** 🔐: Secure login and registration for managers and employees.
- **Dashboard for managers & users** 📊: A centralized hub for viewing events, notifications, and employee availability.
- **Event Management** 🔄: Tools for creating, editing, and viewing shifts, with visual cues for availability and conflicts.

### Database 🗄️

For data storage, **MongoDB** (or **MySQL**, depending on project needs) will manage user information, event data, and other relevant details. The database design will focus on:

- **Data Integrity** ✔️: Ensuring that all user and shift data is stored accurately and efficiently.
- **Scalability** 📈: Designing the database structure to accommodate future growth as the application scales.
